Using the App API concept, this pattern can be changed and \"myfunction\" can be exposed as an individual API. This makes it easier for developers to document APIs and expose them to clients.</p>"},{"location":"api/#documenting-an-existing-app","title":"Documenting an Existing App","text":"<p>In the first use case, we assume that there already is an existing Dashjoin App. It works using the UI and the developer would now like to expose parts of this app via OpenAPI.</p> <p>Consider the following example. The app contains a simple invoke function that computes \"{\"result\": x+y}\" and this function should be exposed as an OpenAPI REST service.</p> <p>First, you need to create an OpenAPI skeleton description and place it into the app's upload folder, e.g. at upload/openapi.yaml:</p> <pre><code>openapi: \"3.0.3\"\ninfo:\nversion: \"1\"\ntitle: \"test\"\nx-dashjoin:\nfunctions:\n- add\nsecurity:\n- Basic_Auth: []\ncomponents:\nsecuritySchemes:\nBasic_Auth:\ntype: \"http\"\nscheme: \"basic\"\n</code></pre> <p>This specification is written in YAML and contains some basic metadata about the API version and description. It also specifies that clients can connect using HTTP basic authentication. Please note that you can author these specifications using this online editor. The SwaggerHub offering also allows you to save the specs in the cloud. See the dashjoin repository and the raw YAML spec.</p> <p>In the \"x-dashjoin\" section, we specify that the function \"add\" is to be added to the API. Normally, the API path, schema, response types, etc. would have to be added. In our case, the Dashjoin platform generates that into this template.</p> <p>Once this file is saved, follow these steps:</p> <ul> <li>Connect the template with the platform, by adding \"url\": \"file:upload/openapi.yaml\" to the \"openapi\" system configuration setting (/#/resource/config/dj-config/openapi)</li> <li>Open the platform Swagger-UI (/swagger-ui/)</li> <li>In the text field at the top, change \"/openapi\" to \"/rest/manage/openapi\"</li> <li>Authorize using your credentials</li> <li>Test the service by sending this JSON payload: {\"x\":1, \"y\": 2}</li> </ul> <p>Apart from functions, you can also publish queries and schemas. Queries work just like functions. Schemas can be derived from tables known to the system. To include these in the App API, you can use these keywords in the OpenAPI template:</p> <pre><code>x-dashjoin:\nfunctions:\n- add\nqueries:\n- group\nschemas:\n- dj/northwind/US_STATES\n</code></pre> <p>Unfortunately, it might not be clear to clients, that the request is expected to be an object containing the keys x and y. In order to make this clear, we can either provide a more description JSON Schema for the request object or we can provide a descriptive example. You can add the following fragment to the OpenAPI description:</p> <pre><code>paths:\n/rest/function/add:\npost:\noperationId: \"add\"\nrequestBody:\ncontent:\napplication/json:\nschema:\nexample:\nx: 1\ny: 2\n</code></pre> <p>This YAML tree structure will be merged with the one generated by the Dashjoin platform. Specifically, the example key will be merged providing clear documentation on how to call the service.</p> <p>The OpenAPI specification can be accessed without credentials. If credentials are provided (e.g. via curl http://admin:djdjdj@localhost:8080/rest/manage/openapi), the platform also generates result set metadata for the queries. For instance, if the group query in the Dashjoin Demo App is included, the following OpenAPI path response is generated:</p> <pre><code>  responses:\n\"200\":\ncontent:\napplication/json:\nschema:\ntype: \"array\"\nitems:\ntype: \"object\"\nproperties:\nCOUNTRY:\ntype: \"string\"\nx-dbType: \"CHARACTER VARYING\"\nNumber of Customers:\nx-dbType: \"BIGINT\"\ndescription: \"group response\"\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"api/#implementing-an-existing-openapi-specification","title":"Implementing an existing OpenAPI Specification","text":"<p>The second use case highlights a scenario where we work in an API centric fashion.

For this example, we'll use a Postgres DB that is registered under the name \"postgres\".</p> <p>The platform offers an API that allows creating a table directly from the OpenAPI spec. Note that the first property is assumed to be the primary key. We'll create the Pet table using this curl command:</p> <pre><code>curl -X 'POST' \\\n  'http://localhost:8080/rest/manage/createTable/postgres' \\\n  -H 'accept: */*' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46ZGpkamRq' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' \\\n  -d 'Pet'\n</code></pre> <p>Once you update the database to trigger the table scan, the Pet table shows up.

For simplicity, we'll add basic authentication:</p> <pre><code>  securitySchemes:\nBasic_Auth:\ntype: \"http\"\nscheme: \"basic\"\n</code></pre> <p>We'll implement the addPet and getPetById calls. So you'll have to allow basic authentication with these calls by adding:</p> <pre><code>  /pet/{petId}:\n...\nsecurity:\n- Basic_Auth: []\n- api_key: []\n- petstore_auth:\n- write:pets\n- read:pets\n</code></pre> <pre><code>  /pet:\nput:\n...\npost:\n...\nsecurity:\n- Basic_Auth: []\n- petstore_auth:\n- write:pets\n- read:pets\n</code></pre> <p>Now you can reload the Swagger UI with the OpenAPI spec at /rest/manage/openapi, login using basic authentication, and test the find pet by ID call with petId 123. The resulting JSON is:</p> <pre><code>{\n\"parameters\": {\n\"petId\": \"123\"\n},\n\"body\": null\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Likewise, the result of the addPet call - using the sample parameters provided - is:</p> <pre><code>{\n\"parameters\": null,\n\"body\": {\n\"id\": 10,\n\"name\": \"doggie\",\n\"category\": {\n\"id\": 1,\n\"name\": \"Dogs\"\n},\n\"photoUrls\": [\n\"string\"\n],\n\"tags\": [\n{\n\"id\": 0,\n\"name\": \"string\"\n}\n],\n\"status\": \"available\"\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You can see that the generic API handler always passes an object to the function.

Since the structure of the body matches the JSON schema that was used to generate the table, we can pass it one to one.

Therefore, we can export it using another API call:</p> <pre><code>http://admin:djdjdj@localhost:8080/rest/manage/saveapi\n</code></pre> <p>Since we configured the OpenAPI spec to be read from a file URL, the system updates the file to include the new schema, making it available for other tooling.

So we can define the samples:</p> <pre><code>p_name: Mike\np_age: 20\n</code></pre> <p>This results in the following query that is used when editing the query. So in the edit dialog, the following query is used (note that the system automatically handles quotation of strings and dates):</p> <pre><code>select * from PERSON where NAME='Mike' and AGE&gt;20\n</code></pre> <p>Once the editor is closed, the samples are replaced with the template variables again.

There are different flavors of graph query languages. We orient ourselves at the OpenCypher language and the upcoming GQL Standard. Like queries on document and relational database, graph queries return a table where the columns represent the projection variables and each row contains variable values that match the query pattern / path.</p> <p>The difference between the query types is that a graph query may return very different record types for a column / variable. Consider a graph query that returns all related records that are reachable with two hops from the starting record. Obviously, you will end up on very different records. In the northwind case, starting from an employee, these might be orders processed by the employee, the employee's boss's boss, and so on. Therefore, Dashjoin graph queries will make sure that apart from the raw data, the result also contains type information that can be used by the UI in order to interpret the values.</p> <p>Graph queries can be run on a specific or on all databases. Dashjoin contains a partial OpenCypher implementation. Consider the following OpenCypher  example (to learn OpenCypher, please refer to this interactive guide):</p> <pre><code>MATCH \n  path=(start:`dj/northwind/EMPLOYEES`)-[r1:REPORTS_TO]-&gt;(boss)-[r2:REPORTS_TO]-&gt;(finish) \nRETURN \n  start._dj_resource, boss.LAST_NAME, finish._dj_resource, path\"\n</code></pre> <p>This query traverses the recursive \"reports to\" relationship. The variables start, boss, and finish represent the graph nodes. As mentioned before, the engine adds the record metadata. i.e. which database and table / collection the record comes from. The path variable matches the entire traversal and contains all nodes and edges (relationships) that were traversed.</p> <p>AQL and SPARQL Property Paths are alternative graph query languages that can be pushed down to the native database query engine if the query is run on the respective ArangoDB / RDF4J database. The Dashjoin drivers make sure that the query result has the same structure as a corresponding OpenCypher query.</p> <p>Note that the graphical query editor does not yet support composing graph queries.</p>"},{"location":"developer-reference/#user-interface-layout","title":"User Interface Layout","text":"<p>While Dashjoin has a rich default page layout that is suitable for many use cases, every aspects of the display can be configured using the functionality described in this section.</p>"},{"location":"developer-reference/#pages-dashboard","title":"Pages Dashboard","text":"<p>The pages dashboard provides you with an overview of the available pages in the system.

When building an application, you might find it useful to create reusable layouts. These are called custom widgets. To create a widget, navigate to the pages dashboard and follow the link to widgets.</p> <p>Let's do a walkthrough of a small example. Create a widget called \"tooltip-icon\", navigate to the widget's page, and enter the edit mode. On the \"Widget preview\" element, open the second context menu with the tooltip Widget \"tooltip-icon\" in order to define the widget. In the editor, select the widget \"icon\", remove the element text and enter \"reusable\" in the tooltip, and save the layout. You now created a custom widget called tooltip-icon that carries a reusable configuration.</p> <p>Next, you need to do a browser reload, since the editor caches custom widgets and needs to pick up the new widget. Navigate to the home page and add two widgets. Edit both widgets, select \"tooltip-icon\" as the widget type, and use icon home and search respectively. Note that the different icons show up, but both show the tooltip \"reusable\". The layout editor also shows two context menus. The left menu with tooltip \"Page Home\" edits how the the tooltip-icon widget is embedded. The right menu with tooltip \"Widget tooltip-icon\" edits the widget itself. If you open the editor there and select a different tooltip, the next value is applied to both home and search.</p> <p>Obviously this example is very simplistic, however it demonstrates how you can create reusable sub layouts.

The expression result can be a map of table names to an array of rows (JSON objects). If the expression result has a simpler structure (for instance only a single table), the ETL function wraps this in a default table called \"table\".</p> <p>If you want to load a large amount of data, you can use the \"foreach\" expression to specify how to split the loading process into smaller parts. Assume you have a directory with thousands of files to load. The foreach expression can list the files using <code>$ls(\"url\")</code>. The expression then specifies how each file is handled. Its <code>$</code> context is set to each individual URL and the expression and subsequent ETL are called for each URL individually.</p> <p>Note that you can also stream large JSON, XML, or CSV files via the streamJson, streamXml, and streamCsv functions. In this case, these functions split a large file into smaller chunks which are then passed to the mapping expression.</p> <p>Consider the following example expressions: <pre><code>$openExcel(\"https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/4/E/14EDED28-6C58-4055-A65C-23B4DA81C4DE/Financial%20Sample.xlsx\")\n</code></pre></p> <p>Note that you have the full power of JSONata available for this operation. Consider the following example. We'd like to incrementally load files that are placed in an upload folder. Only files that have been added since the last run should be considered: <pre><code>$ls(\"file:upload/delta\")[modified &gt; $jobStatus().start].url.$openJson($);\n</code></pre></p> <p>The ls function returns an array containing objects with the modified file timestamp as well as the url of the file. The jobStatus function returns information about the last job run. Therefore, we can filter the files to only include the ones that have a modified timestamp after the job ran last.</p> <p>The setting \"ETL worker threads\" can be used to achieve parallel writes to the database. This setting is only applicable if a foreach expression is specified. In this case, the setting \"ignore ETL errors and continue process\" specifies that any error that occurs when streaming a large file (e.g. a formatting error towards the end of the file) or when workers map and write the contents to the database (e.g. due a malformatted date string) are ignored and do not stop the other workers.</p>"},{"location":"developer-reference/#receive","title":"Receive","text":"<p>The receive function allows handling cases, where the platform is being sent data that is to be processed and saved into a database.

The create schema parameter works like in the ETL case and optionally adapts the underlying schema to accommodate new fields and tables. Receive defines a parameter called sample where a stream data sample can be added. This sample data is used to edit the mapping.

If you're creating a page without the toolbar, you have two options: 1) If you're working with docker or the installer, you can edit the dashboard page in the respective file on the file system. 2) You can navigate to any \"normal\" page, enter edit mode, navigate to the fullscreen page, make changes via the edit context menu, navigate back to the \"normal\" page and save there.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Dashjoin Demo Application contains some interesting examples. How can I apply them to my application? You can either locate your application on the file system and copy an example page there or you can look at the page in order to see which settings to add in the layout editor dialogs (e.g. a JSONata expression).</p> </li> <li> <p>I have an object with special characters in the field names (e.g. a SQL query result). How can I access this field in JSONata? In JSONata, field names can be escaped using back-ticks (`). Click here for a live example.</p> </li> <li> <p>I have an object with special characters in the field names (e.g. a SQL query result). How can I access this field in the HTML widget? The HTML widget uses EJS, which allows embedding JavaScript templates in HTML. In Javascript, you can access non-alphanummeric field names as follows: <code>object[\"field.name\"]</code>. Click here for a live example.</p> </li> <li> <p>How can I customize the forms in the edit, button and variable widgets? These widgets use the JSON Schema Form component. This online playground lets you experiment with the various features. This component comes with a WYSIWYG editor which is available in edit mode by clicking the three vertical dot icon. Note that not all features of the component are exposed in the WYSIWYG editor. You can leverage the advanced features by editing the underlying JSON directly. The demo application shows two examples. The \"createSchema\" of the customer page section shows the form of the email button, which displays the email body input field with a larger text box. The city instance page shows a similar layout for the edit widget. The variable example shows how a select widget with display names and values can be rendered.</p> </li> <li> <p>How can I use values from the database in the edit, button and variable widgets? This can be achieved by combining the JSON Schema Form extension mechanism described in the section above with the API. In the example below, all values from the table test in the DB sql are retrieved. The jsonata expression projects the column id to be used as the auto-complete choices in the input field.</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>{\n    \"widget\": \"button\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"test\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"createSchema\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"test\": {\n                \"type\": \"string\",\n                \"choicesUrl\": \"/rest/database/all/sql/test\",\n                \"jsonata\": \"id\",\n                \"choicesVerb\": \"POST\"\n            }\n        }\n    },\n},\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>Are SQL stored procedures supported? Yes, simply use 'exec proc' or 'call proc(par)' as the query, depending on the SQL dialect used by your DB. In case a stored procedure has multiple result tables, the $query function returns them by wrapping them in a top level object.</p> </li> <li> <p>How can I access a SQL Server stored procedure output variable? This can be done on the query level as follows:</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>DECLARE @res INT;\nexec dbo.sp @res output;\nselect @res;\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>Why am I getting the error: \"User does not have the role required to read table page in database config\" after logging in? When the UI renders a page, it needs to get the page layout from the backend. Like with any other call, the user's credentials are checked. This error indicates, that the user is known to the system, but gets assigned insufficient roles to access this information in the config DB. To fix this, you can either assign the user the correct role in the IDM or you can provide read access to the config DB to the user's role (this is done on the System Configuration page).</p> </li> <li> <p>Does the platform cache results? Yes, all HTTP GET requests are cached by the browser UI. The cache is purged if 1) five minutes have passed since the last time the data was retrieved, 2) the data is changed in via the UI (e.g. by saving / updating a value), or 3) SHIFT F5 / reload is pressed.</p> </li> <li> <p>How can I download data from the platform? This can be achieved via the HTML widget. And example can be found here. The download happens via a JavaScript function that calls saveAs(new Blob([data]), filename).</p> </li> <li> <p>How can I download binary data such as PDFs or images? This works like the regular download. You usually have a JSONata expression that loads the data in the backend. You can use $openText(url, \"BASE_64\") to get a base64 encoded representation. In the HTML widget, you can use this code to have the browser download the data:</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>function go() {\nconst byteCharacters = atob(context);\nconst byteNumbers = new Array(byteCharacters.length);\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; byteCharacters.length; i++) {\nbyteNumbers[i] = byteCharacters.charCodeAt(i);\n}\nconst byteArray = new Uint8Array(byteNumbers);\nconst blob = new Blob([byteArray], {type: \"application/pdf\"});\nsaveAs(blob, 'download.pdf')\n}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>On the table page, my primary key column is not on the very left and I need to scroll right to get to the instance page link. How can I change this? The default layout uses the native column order defined in the database. This order is used for the overview table as well as for the forms on the instance pages. For the table, simply define a query with your desired column projection order. Note that you can also omit columns if you'd like. Enter the layout editor and use this query for the table widget. On the edit form, you can enter the layout editor and open the form element's context menu via the three dots and change the positioning there.</p> </li> <li> <p>How can I format dates or currency in tables? This can be done on the database query level. If you're using PostgreSQL for instance, this query will format the \"born\" and \"salary\" columns accordingly (assuming their database type is date and int): select to_char(born, 'DD-MON-YYYY'), cast(salary as money) from employee.</p> </li> <li> <p>Why does the browser not show changes performed via an expression called from a button? You need to check the button option \"clearCache\" if your expression makes changes to the database. Otherwise, old values might be shown for five minutes.</p> </li> <li> <p>The display widget shows an object as a material list. Can I transpose the object such that it is displayed as a two column table with colums key and value? This can be done using the following JSONata transformation. For each object key, we create an object where key is the current key and value is the key lookup. This array of objects is then shown as a table.</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>value.(\n$x := $;\n$keys($).{\"key\": $, \"value\": $lookup($x, $)}\n)\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>How can I determine whether it makes sense to define a foreign key on a given column? In some data integration scenarios, it may not be clear whether a column is a good candidate to reference a primary key. Some keys might match, others won't. You can use the following piece of JSONata code to determine to which degree the values intersect. We first get the table data and project the column. The intersection is computed using a JSONata filter which only includes the values in the other array.</li> </ul> <pre><code>(\n$t1 := $all(\"db1\", \"table1\").column1;\n$t2 := $all(\"db2\", \"table2\").column2;\n{\n\"count1\": $count($t1),\n\"count2\": $count($t2),\n\"intersect\": $count($t2[$ in $t1])\n}\n)\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>Can I trigger a git pull of the App in production without a restart? You can run $gitPull() as a function or on the Dashjoin Notebook.</p> </li> <li> <p>Can I call the OpenAI APIs from Dashjoin? Yes, register the following function (replace your API key accordingly) can call it:</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>{\n\"djClassName\": \"org.dashjoin.function.RestJson\",\n\"ID\": \"openai\",\n\"type\": \"read\",\n\"method\": \"POST\",\n\"contentType\": \"application/json\",\n\"headers\": {\n\"Authorization\": \"Bearer YOUR-API-KEY-HERE\"\n},\n\"url\": \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\"\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>$call(\"openai\", {\n\"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Say this is a test!\"}],\n\"temperature\": 0.7\n})\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>I have a table with a unique column which is not the primary key, can I ETL into this table from a datasource which only contains this key and not the primary key? Yes, you can lookup a record using the $all function. Let's consider the following example from the northwind database, where employee names are given with an email address, but not the employee ID. We can use the $all function to retrieve the record by last name and project the id which is then merged into the original record. Note that this runs one query per row. Alternatively, you can create a lookup table (unique2key), store it in a variable, and use $lookup to get the primary key to merge.</li> </ul> <pre><code>[{\"id\": \"Davolio\", \"email\": \"davolio@example.org\"}, {\"id\": \"Fuller\", \"email\": \"fuller@acme.org\"}]\n.$merge([\n$, {\"EMPLOYEE_ID\": $all(\"northwind\", \"EMPLOYEES\", null, null, null, false, {\"LAST_NAME\": id}).EMPLOYEE_ID}\n])\n</code></pre> <pre><code>(\n$input := [{\"id\": \"Davolio\", \"email\": \"davolio@example.org\"}, {\"id\": \"Fuller\", \"email\": \"fuller@acme.org\"}];\n$unique2key := $all(\"northwind\", \"EMPLOYEES\").{LAST_NAME: EMPLOYEE_ID};\n$input.$merge([$, {\"EMPLOYEE_ID\": $lookup($unique2key, $.id)}])\n)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"getting-started/","title":"Getting Started: 15 Minute Tour","text":"<p>This section will guide you through the various features of the Dashjoin low code development platform.

The table shows the databases that are available to the system so far. You should see the northwind database there.</p> <p>Since northwind is a non-persistent in memory database, we will create a new database. This can be done with the create widget on the page. Select the following values and press \"create\":</p> <pre><code>type: SQLDatabase\nname: sqlite\nurl:  jdbc:sqlite:your_database.db\n</code></pre> <p>From the database page, click on the sqlite database you just created. This brings you to the database details page. The connection information section allows you to make changes to the connection. Note that you can also simply click update in order to recollect the database metadata in case the schema was changed using another application.</p> <p>If you are in the admin role, you can expand the database management section. Using the form, create a table called \"REQUESTS\". This operation creates the table with two columns: ID is the numeric primary key and name is a string column describing the record.</p> <p>Go to the table by following the REQUESTS link in the database management table. On the page you can start entering some test data. Note that the SQL database enforces the uniqueness constraint on the ID column. If you try to create a record with an existing ID, you will get an error message: [SQLITE_CONSTRAINT] Abort due to constraint violation (UNIQUE constraint failed: <code>REQUESTS.ID</code>). By inspecting the created table, the system also automatically picks up the datatypes of the columns and requires you to provide an ID.</p> <p>Open the column metadata control and add three more columns:</p> <ul> <li>submitted: date</li> <li>customer: string</li> <li>user: string</li> </ul> <p>We can enter, edit and delete records via the user interface. Another option is to upload data. To do this, create a file called REQUESTS.csv (note that the file name must match the case sensitive table name):</p> <pre><code>ID,name,submitted,customer,user\n1,Can you please send me an offer,2021-01-01 10:20,ALFKI,user\n2,Delivery arrived,2021-01-01 10:20,ALFKI,user\n3,Delivery delayed,2021-01-07 11:32,ALFKI,user\n4,Are you out of crackers,2021-01-04 08:21,BLAUS,other\n5,Need more crackers,2021-11-06 05:20,,admin\n</code></pre> <p>To upload this file, navigate back to the sqlite database page, expand the database management control and select \"Upload Data\". In the dialog, select \"choose files\" and select the file REQUESTS.csv you just created. This brings up a table with a preview (the first 10 rows) of the table. Since the requests table already exists, you cannot select a primary key or the column data type. These options are available if the target table does not yet exist in the database.</p> <p>You have the choice of appending to or replacing the existing data. Choose \"replace\" in order to avoid further primary key clashes. Since we are permanently deleting existing data, we need to confirm this operation by entering \"delete tables\". Note that tables is plural since we can also upload multiple tables at once by selecting a Excel spreadsheet or multiple csv files.</p> <p>Since our application should not change the northwind ERP database, we created the new table in a new database. Nevertheless, there is a logical connection between the two databases, since the customer field in the requests table references the CUSTOMERS table in the northwind database. Dashjoin allows you to express this relationship even tough it links columns and records in different databases.</p> <p>Navigate to the REQUESTS table and open the column metadata control. In the table, select the customers column and click edit. In the popup, type \"CUSTOMER_ID\" in the foreign key reference field. The system suggests all known columns that contain this substring. Select \"dj/northwind/CUSTOMERS/CUSTOMER_ID\" and press ok. Since we made a change to the database metadata and the application caches this data, we need to clear the browser application cache by reloading the page.</p> <p>After the reload, you will notice that the customer column in the table now shows a hyperlink to the related record in the customer table. Likewise, if you navigate onto a request or onto a customer, the related records are displayed even though they reside in a different database. In addition, if you start typing in the request creation's customer field, you will notice that the matching northwind customer IDs are showing up.</p> <p>Navigate to the customer ALFKI (northwind/CUSTOMERS/ALFKI). The list of requests made by this customer shows up as a list of hyperlinks (1, 2, and 3). As a default, Dashjoin uses the primary key value as a link label, however we can customize this. Go to the REQUESTS table page, open the table metadata control and enter <code>${name}</code> in the dj-label field. This string is a template syntax where constant strings can be mixed with template variables referencing columns. So a person template could be <code>${LAST_NAME}, ${FIRST_NAME}</code>.</p> <p>Save this change and reload the browser. The visit the first request. You will notice that the browser window title now displays the new label. Going back to the requests table you will see that any request that was visited, now shows a nice name. Likewise, if you go back to customer ALFKI, the list also shows the readable link labels (assuming they all have been visited).</p> <p>Go back to the requests table and enter the letter 'a' in the customer field of the create form. You will see the autocomplete options with the customer IDs starting with 'a'. The customer IDs are five letter strings. This is better than a plain number, but let's also choose a display name for customers. Again, we can do this by navigating to the customer table (/table/northwind/CUSTOMERS), opening the table metadata control and entering the dj-label <code>${COMPANY_NAME}</code>. Reload the browser and go back to the requests table. If you type 'a' into the customers create field, you will see the list of customer display names that start with 'a'. Note that the tooltip shows the underlying five letter primary key. This feature is very useful if tables use unreadable keys.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#restricting-access","title":"Restricting Access","text":"<p>Dashjoin makes it very easy to secure data based on user roles. To view the roles know to the system, go to the info page linked in the toolbar. The top left widget display the following information:</p> <ul> <li>The name of the current user (should be user name 'admin')</li> <li>The roles the current user is in (should be the user role 'admin')</li> <li>A link to the role management page</li> </ul> <p>Follow the link to the roles page. On there, you can define new roles and define the home page for users in this role. In the system there are several places where you will be able to select the roles defined here. The role IDs you choose depend on the identity management system that is configured. In the Dashjoin PaaS, this is OpenID. If you are using the open source default installation, the roles are defined in the djroles.properties file:</p> <pre><code>admin: dj,admin\nuser: dj,authenticated\n</code></pre> <p>This file defines the users admin and user with roles admin and authenticated and both having the password dj. Therefore, the default system roles are admin and authenticated. If your identity management system defines other roles, you can define them on the roles management page in order to make them usable in the system. We will leave this unchanged for now.</p> <p>In the next step, use a different browser or an incognito window and login user user with password dj. Except for the toolbar, the system looks pretty much the same. Navigate to the info page. You will need to type /page/Info into the browser, since the toolbar icon is not displayed. Verify that the page shows user in role authenticated. Click on \"system roles\" and \"admin\" and press delete. You will get the error message: \"User does not have the role required to delete table dj-role in database config\". The authenticated role has read access to the config database, but cannot create, delete or update any records.</p> <p>By default, new databases are only accessible for the admin. We can demonstrate this by searching for the term \"cracker\". In the admin browser, you get a total of seven results from both the northwind and sqlite databases.</p> <p>If you preform the same search in the user browser, you only get the five northwind results.</p> <p>The northwind database grants read only access to the authenticated role. You can check this on the page /config/dj-database/dj%2Fnorthwind.</p> <p>Now let's grant access to the sqlite database. Go to the page /config/dj-database/dj%2Fsqlite, select the authenticated role for both the read and write roles and save your change. Note that the admin role already has implicit access, therefore it is not listed in the options.</p> <p>Go back to the user browser and repeat the search. Now you'll get the same result as in the admin window. You can also navigate to a request and make a change since write access has been granted.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#user-layouts","title":"User Layouts","text":"<p>This section explains how we can customize the layouts and how we can display different user interfaces depending on which role the user is in.</p> <p>For our application, we'd like the users to have a page where they can see their past requests and where they can issue a new request. A request should only consist of the text. The fields ID, submitted and user should be determined by the system.</p> <p>We start with the admin browser and navigate to the \"dashboard pages\" via the toolbar. Using the \"Create a new page\" control, create a new page called \"Start\". We will use this as the homepage for authenticated users. This can be setup on the authenticated role page (config/dj-role/authenticated). Enter \"/page/Start\" to specify the start page as the homepage for users in this role. We need to logout and back in using the user browser to pick up this setting. Clicking the home icon will now get you to the start page which at this point only shows a single tile with the text \"New page\".</p> <p>In order to create this page, we need to use the admin browser. Before we add widgets to this page, we need to create a query that filters the user's requests and that projects the request columns in a suitable way.</p> <p>This can be done using the query catalog and query editor. Navigate to the query catalog via the toolbar and in the create form, press the editor button. In the popup, select the sqlite database and the requests table. Using the dropdown, you can add the field user to the query. In the filter field, enter \"user\". Now we just need to hide the user column (select remove column from the column context menu) and drag &amp; drop the name column to the first position. The query should be:</p> <pre><code>SELECT\n\"REQUESTS\".\"name\", \"REQUESTS\".\"submitted\"\nFROM\n\"REQUESTS\"\nWHERE\nREQUESTS.user = 'user'\n</code></pre> <p>Press OK to leave the query editor. Before creating the query, we need to add the ID (requests), type (read), and roles (admin, authenticated). The query needs one more argument, namely the current user. This can be specified by pressing the + symbol and adding the parameter user with type string and example \"user\". The example is used when editing a parameterized query in the editor. Finally, in the query text field, replace 'user' with <code>${user}</code>. This indicates that the query has a dynamic parameter that is inserted into the query before it is run. Now save the query by pressing \"create\". At a later point, you can always go back and make changes to the query (e.g. add a join or another projection).</p> <p>Now we navigate to the page start and enter the layout editor by pressing the pen symbol. We can now make changes to the page. Press the context menu under the text \"New page\" and select edit. This widget currently is a text widget displaying a static text. Instead we'd like a table showing our query result. Select the following:</p> <pre><code>widget: table\nquery: requests\ndatabase: sqlite\ntitle: My Requests\narguments: {\"user\": $.user}\n</code></pre> <p>Press ok and the floppy disk symbol to save the new layout. You should now see a table with one row. Go to the user browser and reload the page. You should see three requests there.</p> <p>We created a table widget that runs the requests query on the sqlite database. Now the requests query needs an argument called user. Dashjoin uses a JSON object to pass such parameters. Specifically, <code>$.user</code> reads the current username from the context. We will leave it at that, please refer to the developer guide for a full documentation of these expressions.</p> <p>Now we are missing the functionality to submit new data. We can achieve this with the button widget. Enter the edit mode again and select add from the table widget's context menu. A new widget appears which we edit. Select the following values:</p> <pre><code>widget: button\ntext: Submit\ntitle: New Requests\nargument: name / string\n</code></pre> <p>This adds a form and a button to the page. There are three context menus, the top one for the widget, the middle one for the form, and the lower one for the name form element. Edit the last one and select these values:</p> <pre><code>widget: textarea\ntitle: Your message\nCSS styles: width / 400px, height / 200px\n</code></pre> <p>These settings change the default text field to a larger multi line text area. Finally, let's edit the button widget again to define what happens when the button is pressed. Enter the following expression in the field \"run this when clicked and display the result\":</p> <pre><code>$create(\n  \"sqlite\", \n  \"REQUESTS\", \n  {\n    \"ID\": $ceil($random()*1000000), \n    \"user\": $.user, \n    \"name\": $.form.name, \n    \"submitted\": $now()\n  }\n)\n</code></pre> <p>Let's break down what is happening here. <code>$create</code> is a function which creates the record (3rd parameter) in the database (1st parameter) and the table (2nd parameter) specified. Database and table are static strings. The record consists of four dynamic fields:</p> <p>The ID is computed by taking a random number (between 0 and 1), multiplying it with 1 million and rounding it up. Thus the ID is a random number between 1 and 1 million, providing reasonable protection from duplicate IDs.</p> <p>The user is computed using the same construct (<code>$.user</code>) as for the table widget above.</p> <p>The name is specified as <code>$.form.name</code>. The rationale is the following: The user entries are stored in a JSON object form which hangs under the context $. In this object, we choose the name specified as the button argument.</p> <p>Finally, the submitted field is the current timestamp computed with <code>$now()</code>.</p> <p>After saving the layout, you can test the functionality. Note that you need to refresh the page after a value is submitted.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#admin-layout","title":"Admin Layout","text":"<p>The application administrator already has the ability to browse and search the data. However, it would be nice to add a chart to the system. To do this we first need to create another query.</p> <p>Follow the steps as before and project the columns user and name. Next, select the column user and group by this column. The resulting query should be:</p> <pre><code>SELECT\n\"REQUESTS\".\"user\", COUNT(\"REQUESTS\".\"name\")\nFROM\n\"REQUESTS\"\nGROUP BY\n\"REQUESTS\".\"user\"\n</code></pre> <p>Save the query under the name \"requestsPerUser\". Next, navigate to the REQUESTS table and enter the layout editor. Add a widget to the page and choose these settings:</p> <pre><code>widget: chart\ntitle: Requests Per User\nquery: requestsPerUser\ndatabase: sqlite\nchart: doughnut\n</code></pre> <p>Finally, let's assume we'd like a notification when a new request is submitted. We can do this by creating a trigger on the request table. Open the table metadata section and enter the following expression for the field \"Trigger to call before a new record is created\":</p> <pre><code>$echo($)\n</code></pre> <p>This trigger is a simple expression that calls the echo function. Echo takes an object which is written to the system console. In this case the entire context is written. Once you save and submit another request, you should see a line like this in the console:</p> <pre><code>{database=sqlite, search=null, command=create, table=REQUESTS, object={ID=762613, user=user, name=My test entry, submitted=2020-12-31T15:50:35.755459500Z}}\n</code></pre> <p>Instead of calling the echo function, we can of course send an email or perform any other kind of action. A common use case is to automatically set the createdBy and createdOn fields. This can be achieved by setting the after create trigger to:</p> <pre><code>$update(database, table, object.ID, {\\\"createdBy\\\": $djUser(), \\\"createdOn\\\": $now()})\n</code></pre> <p>Note that triggers can invoke each other recursively. If this expression would be the update trigger,  we might end up with an endless recursion resulting in a stack overflow.
